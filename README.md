# Factory Line Process Controller

## Overview

The Factory Line Process Controller is a Python-based simulation project designed to model an automated production line. This project utilizes the SimPy library, along with `time` and potentially other libraries, to replicate key aspects of a manufacturing workflow, including item processing, resource management, and operation timing.

This project emphasizes event-driven simulation to analyze efficiency, workflow optimization, and real-time process interactions in an industrial setting.

## Key Aspects

-   **Simulation of factory processes**: Models item arrival, processing, and departure with precise timing and resource constraints.
-   **Usage of SimPy for discrete-event simulation**: Defines machines and queues as resources within SimPy to analyze production efficiency.
-   **Integration of time-based delays**: Implements execution timing and realistic process delays to mimic factory operations.
-   **(Potential) Statistical Analysis**: Collects and analyzes data on throughput, machine utilization, and queue lengths.
-   **(Potential) Visualization**: Uses libraries like Matplotlib to visualize simulation results.

## Project Structure

```

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or create the project files.**
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the main Python script:

```bash
python factory_simulation.py
```

The script will output simulation results, such as average waiting times, machine utilization, and total items processed.
